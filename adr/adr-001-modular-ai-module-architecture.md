# ADR-001: Modular AI Model Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs to handle multiple AI models (Whisper, YOLO, BLIP, PANN) for different types of analysis.

## Decision
- Implement each AI model as a separate module in `src/ai_models/`
- Use interface/abstract base classes for model implementations
- Lazy load models to manage memory efficiently
- Allow model path configuration via environment variables

## Consequences
+ Better separation of concerns
+ Easy to add new AI models
+ Memory efficient through lazy loading
- Additional complexity in model management
